# IEEE Fraud Detection System

## About Me
I love data. I am currently studying cybersecurity.

## Project Overview
This project involves the detection of fraudulent transactions using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a Random Forest model. The system is designed to analyze and classify transactions, flagging potential fraudulent activities. This project was inspired by a Kaggle competition.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition on Kaggle. The data includes transactional information that is used to train and test the model for fraud detection.

## Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand the data distribution, detect anomalies, and identify patterns.
- **Random Forest Model**: To build a robust fraud detection system capable of classifying transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## Results
The project achieved significant accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions, showcasing the effectiveness of using Random Forest for classification tasks in fraud detection.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and clean.
2. **Model Training**: Use the `train_model.py` script to train the Random Forest model on the dataset.
3. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Use the trained model to predict fraud on new data and evaluate its performance using various metrics.
